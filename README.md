# pands-problem-sheet
This repository contains all of the problem sheets which we completed through the module 'Programming and Scripting'

The work carried out these problems were first done each week within the 'Programming2021Coursework' repository https://github.com/ShaneKelly89/Programming2021Coursework.git where they can be located each week alongside the labs which were also carried out each week.
