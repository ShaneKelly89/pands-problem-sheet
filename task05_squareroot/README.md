Task 05 Square Root 

Summary of the Program\
This is a program which takes in a positive floating-point number as input, and outputs the approximation of its square root.\
Newton's method was researched and used in this program for square root.\
This was then used to created a function for square root, named 'sqRt' within the program.
The user will be asked to input a positive integer. For the purpose of this task, that interger will be: 12.5\
The program will then output the approx. square root, which should be :
